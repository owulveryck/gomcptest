# Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This document explains the Model Context Protocol (MCP), how it works, why it was designed this way, and how it enables agentic systems in gomcptest.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a lightweight, language-agnostic protocol for communication between language models and tools. It defines a standardized way for language models to request actions from external tools and incorporate the results into their reasoning process.

MCP is designed to be:
- **Simple**: Using JSON-RPC over stdio for maximum compatibility
- **Extensible**: Supporting various tool types with different capabilities
- **Language-agnostic**: Working with tools written in any programming language
- **Secure**: Isolating tools in separate processes for security

## The Problem MCP Solves

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful at reasoning and generating content but have limitations when they need to:
1. Access up-to-date information
2. Read from or write to the external environment
3. Perform complex calculations
4. Access specialized knowledge databases

Early approaches like function calling had several limitations:
- Functions were part of the application's codebase
- Adding new capabilities required modifying the application
- Function implementations were tightly coupled with the LLM interaction code
- Isolation and security boundaries were not well-defined

MCP addresses these issues by providing a clean separation between the model (host) and the tools while maintaining a standardized communication protocol.

## How MCP Works in gomcptest

### Communication Flow

In gomcptest, the MCP implementation follows this flow:

1. **Tool Registration**: When the OpenAI server starts, it spawns each MCP tool as a separate process
2. **Manifest Exchange**: Each tool provides a manifest describing its capabilities
3. **Function Definition**: The server presents these tools to the model as available functions
4. **Function Calling**: When the model decides to call a function, the server:
   - Sends the function call to the appropriate tool process via JSON-RPC
   - Receives the result from the tool
   - Sends the result back to the model for further processing
5. **Result Integration**: The model incorporates the tool's result into its response

### JSON-RPC Protocol

MCP uses JSON-RPC over standard input/output to communicate between the host and tools. A typical exchange looks like this:

From host to tool:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call",
  "params": {
    "name": "Bash",
    "params": {
      "command": "ls -la"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

From tool to host:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "total 24\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 user  group  160 Jan 10 10:00 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user  group   96 Jan 10 09:59 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   14 Jan 10 10:00 README.md",
  "id": 1
}
```

### Tool Process Lifecycle

In gomcptest, MCP tools follow this lifecycle:
1. **Initialization**: The tool process starts and waits for input on stdin
2. **Registration**: The host sends a "register" method call to get the tool's capabilities
3. **Operation**: The host sends "call" method calls when the model invokes the tool
4. **Termination**: The tool process exits when stdin is closed or after an explicit shutdown command

## Design Decisions Behind MCP

### Why Standard I/O?

MCP uses standard input/output for several reasons:
- It's available in every programming language
- It doesn't require network configuration or port management
- It provides a natural process isolation boundary
- It's simple to implement and understand

### Why Separate Processes?

Running tools as separate processes has several advantages:
- **Security**: Tools run with their own permissions and are isolated from each other
- **Stability**: A crashed tool doesn't crash the entire system
- **Language Flexibility**: Tools can be written in any language
- **Resource Management**: Each tool can be monitored and managed separately

### Why JSON-RPC?

JSON-RPC was chosen because:
- It's lightweight and well-standardized
- It supports bidirectional communication with explicit request-response pairing
- It works well over streams like stdin/stdout
- It's human-readable for debugging purposes

## MCP vs. Other Approaches

### MCP vs. Direct Function Calling

Unlike direct function calling, MCP:
- Executes functions in separate processes
- Allows functions to be written in any language
- Provides better isolation and security
- Enables functions to be updated without modifying the host

### MCP vs. REST APIs

Compared to REST APIs, MCP:
- Doesn't require network configuration
- Has lower latency for frequent calls
- Provides stronger process isolation
- Is simpler to set up for local tool execution

### MCP vs. Plugins

Unlike plugin systems, MCP:
- Is language-agnostic
- Doesn't require a shared memory model
- Has simpler security boundaries
- Is more lightweight and doesn't require a plugin loading infrastructure

## Evolution and Future Directions

MCP is still evolving, and future enhancements might include:

- **Streaming Results**: Supporting progressive results from long-running tools
- **Bi-directional Interaction**: Allowing tools to ask for clarification from the model
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of available tools
- **Authentication**: More robust authentication between host and tools
- **Resource Limits**: Better controls for CPU, memory, and time usage

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol provides a clean, extensible way for LLMs to interact with external tools. In gomcptest, it enables the separation of concerns between the OpenAI-compatible server and the various tools it can use to perform actions in the environment.

By understanding MCP, you can better appreciate how gomcptest enables experimentation with agentic systems while maintaining a clean architectural separation between components.
