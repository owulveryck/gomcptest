This document explains the foundational event system architecture in gomcptest that enables real-time monitoring of tool interactions, streaming responses, and transparent agentic workflows. This system is implemented across different components and interfaces, with AgentFlow being one specific implementation.

## What is the Event System?

The event system in gomcptest is a foundational architecture that provides real-time visibility into the agentic process. It captures, streams, and presents events that occur during AI-tool interactions, enabling transparency and monitoring of how AI agents make decisions and execute tasks.

The event system is designed as a general-purpose mechanism that can be implemented by different interfaces and components, not tied to any specific UI or implementation.

## Core Event Concepts

### Event-Driven Transparency

Traditional AI interactions are often "black boxes" where users see only the final result. The gomcptest event system provides transparency by exposing:

1. **Tool Call Events**: When the AI decides to use a tool, what tool it chooses, and what parameters it passes
2. **Tool Response Events**: The results returned by tools, including success responses and error conditions
3. **Processing Events**: Internal state changes and decision points during request processing
4. **Stream Events**: Real-time updates as responses are generated

### Event Types

The system defines several core event types:

#### Tool Interaction Events
- **Tool Call Events**: Capture when an AI decides to invoke a tool
- **Tool Response Events**: Capture the results of tool execution
- **Tool Error Events**: Capture failures and error conditions

#### System Events  
- **Stream Start/End Events**: Mark the beginning and end of streaming responses
- **Processing Events**: Internal state changes and milestones
- **Error Events**: System-level errors and exceptions

#### Content Events
- **Content Generation Events**: Incremental content as it's generated
- **Content Completion Events**: Final content delivery
- **Content Metadata Events**: Information about content characteristics

## Event Architecture Patterns

### Producer-Consumer Model

The event system follows a producer-consumer pattern:

1. **Event Producers**: Components that generate events (chat engines, tool executors, stream processors)
2. **Event Channels**: Transport mechanisms for event delivery (Go channels, HTTP streams)
3. **Event Consumers**: Components that process and present events (web interfaces, logging systems, monitors)

### Channel-Based Streaming

Events are delivered through channel-based streaming:

```go
type StreamEvent interface {
    IsStreamEvent() bool
}

// Event channel returned by streaming operations
func SendStreamingRequest() (<-chan StreamEvent, error) {
    eventChan := make(chan StreamEvent, 100)
    
    // Events are sent to the channel as they occur
    go func() {
        defer close(eventChan)
        
        // Generate and send events
        eventChan <- &ToolCallEvent{...}
        eventChan <- &ToolResponseEvent{...}
        eventChan <- &ContentEvent{...}
    }()
    
    return eventChan, nil
}
```

### Event Metadata

Each event carries standardized metadata:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Event Type**: Category and specific type
- **Context**: Related session, request, or operation context
- **Payload**: Event-specific data

## Event Flow Patterns

### Request-Response with Events

Traditional request-response patterns are enhanced with event streaming:

1. **Request Initiated**: System generates start events
2. **Processing Events**: Intermediate steps generate progress events  
3. **Tool Interactions**: Tool calls and responses generate events
4. **Content Generation**: Streaming content generates incremental events
5. **Completion**: Final response and end events

### Event Correlation

Events are correlated through:

- **Session IDs**: Grouping events within a single chat session
- **Request IDs**: Linking events to specific API requests
- **Tool Call IDs**: Connecting tool call and response events
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Hierarchical event relationships

## Implementation Patterns

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

For web interfaces, events are delivered via Server-Sent Events:

```
event: tool_call
data: {"id": "call_123", "name": "Edit", "arguments": {...}}

event: tool_response  
data: {"id": "call_123", "result": "File updated successfully"}

event: content_delta
data: {"delta": "The file has been updated as requested."}
```

### JSON-RPC Event Extensions

For programmatic interfaces, events extend the JSON-RPC protocol:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "event",
  "params": {
    "event_type": "tool_call",
    "event_data": {
      "id": "call_123",
      "name": "Edit", 
      "arguments": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

## Event Processing Strategies

### Real-Time Processing

Events are processed as they occur:

- **Immediate Display**: Critical events are shown immediately
- **Progressive Enhancement**: UI updates incrementally as events arrive
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI shows intended state before confirmation

### Buffering and Batching

For performance optimization:

- **Event Buffering**: Collect multiple events before processing
- **Batch Updates**: Update UI with multiple events simultaneously
- **Debouncing**: Reduce update frequency for high-frequency events

### Error Handling

Robust error handling in event processing:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation when non-critical events fail
- **Event Recovery**: Attempt to recover from event processing errors
- **Fallback Modes**: Alternative processing when event system fails

## Event System Benefits
