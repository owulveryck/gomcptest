## What are MCP Tools?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools are standalone executables that provide specific functions that can be invoked by AI models. They allow the AI to interact with its environment - performing tasks like reading and writing files, executing commands, or searching for information.

In gomcptest, tools are implemented as independent Go executables that follow a standard protocol for receiving requests and returning results through standard input/output streams. Tool interactions generate events that are captured by the [event system](../event-system/), enabling real-time monitoring and transparency.

## Tool Architecture

Each tool in gomcptest follows a consistent architecture:

1. **Standard I/O Interface**: Tools communicate via stdin/stdout using JSON-formatted requests and responses
2. **Parameter Validation**: Tools validate their input parameters according to a JSON schema
3. **Stateless Execution**: Each tool invocation is independent and does not maintain state
4. **Controlled Access**: Tools implement appropriate security measures and permission checks
5. **Structured Results**: Results are returned in a standardized JSON format

### Common Components

Most tools share these common components:

- **Main Function**: Parses JSON input, validates parameters, executes the core function, formats and returns the result
- **Parameter Structure**: Defines the expected input parameters for the tool
- **Result Structure**: Defines the format of the tool's output
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error reporting and handling
- **Security Checks**: Validation to prevent dangerous operations

## Tool Categories

The tools in gomcptest can be categorized into several functional groups:

### Filesystem Navigation

- **LS**: Lists files and directories, providing metadata and structure
- **GlobTool**: Finds files matching specific patterns, making it easier to locate relevant files
- **GrepTool**: Searches file contents using regular expressions, helping find specific information in codebases

### Content Management

- **View**: Reads and displays file contents, allowing the model to analyze existing code or documentation
- **Edit**: Makes targeted modifications to files, enabling precise changes without overwriting the entire file
- **Replace**: Completely overwrites file contents, useful for generating new files or making major changes

### System Interaction

- **Bash**: Executes shell commands, allowing the model to run commands, scripts, and programs
- **dispatch_agent**: A meta-tool that can create specialized sub-agents for specific tasks

### AI/ML Services

- **imagen**: Generates and manipulates images using Google's Imagen API, enabling visual content creation

### Data Processing

- **duckdbserver**: Provides SQL-based data processing capabilities using DuckDB, enabling complex data analysis and transformations

## Design Principles

The tools in gomcptest were designed with several key principles in mind:

### 1. Modularity

Each tool is a standalone executable that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This modular approach allows for:

- Independent development cycles
- Targeted testing
- Simpler debugging
- Ability to add or replace tools without affecting the entire system

### 2. Security

Security is a major consideration in the tool design:

- Tools validate inputs to prevent injection attacks
- File operations are limited to appropriate directories
- Bash command execution is restricted with banned commands
- Timeouts prevent infinite operations
- Process isolation prevents one tool from affecting others

### 3. Simplicity

The tools are designed to be simple to understand and use:

- Clear, focused functionality for each tool
- Straightforward parameter structures
- Consistent result formats
- Well-documented behaviors and limitations

### 4. Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended:

- New tools can be added by following the standard protocol
- Existing tools can be enhanced with additional parameters
- Alternative implementations can replace existing tools

## Tool Protocol Details

The communication protocol for tools follows this pattern:

### Input Format

Tools receive JSON input on stdin in this format:

```json
{
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2",
  "param3": 123
}
```

### Output Format

Tools return JSON output on stdout in one of these formats:

#### Success:

```json
{
  "result": "text result"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "results": [
    {"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"},
    {"field1": "value3", "field2": "value4"}
  ]
}
```

#### Error:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Tool Structure

Most tools follow this basic structure:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

// Parameters defines the expected input structure
type Parameters struct {
	Param1 string `json:"param1"`
	Param2 int    `json:"param2,omitempty"`
}

// Result defines the output structure
type Result struct {
	Result  string `json:"result,omitempty"`
	Error   string `json:"error,omitempty"`
	Code    string `json:"code,omitempty"`
}

func main() {
	// Parse input
	var params Parameters
	decoder := json.NewDecoder(os.Stdin)
	if err := decoder.Decode(&params); err != nil {
		outputError("Failed to parse input", "INVALID_INPUT")
		return
	}

	// Validate parameters
	if params.Param1 == "" {
		outputError("param1 is required", "MISSING_PARAMETER")
		return
	}

	// Execute core functionality
	result, err := executeTool(params)
	if err != nil {
		outputError(err.Error(), "EXECUTION_ERROR")
		return
	}

	// Return result
	output := Result{Result: result}
	encoder := json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout)
	encoder.Encode(output)
}

func executeTool(params Parameters) (string, error) {
	// Tool-specific logic here
	return "result", nil
}

func outputError(message, code string) {
	result := Result{
		Error: message,
		Code:  code,
	}
	encoder := json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout)
	encoder.Encode(result)
}
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Tool Composition

The dispatch_agent tool demonstrates how tools can be composed to create more powerful capabilities. It:

1. Accepts a high-level task description
2. Plans a sequence of tool operations to accomplish the task
3. Executes these operations using the available tools
4. Synthesizes the results into a coherent response

### Error Propagation

The tool error mechanism is designed to provide useful information back to the model:

- Error messages are human-readable and descriptive
- Error codes allow programmatic handling of specific error types
- Stacktraces and debugging information are not exposed to maintain security

### Performance Considerations

Tools are designed with performance in mind:

- File operations use efficient libraries and patterns
- Search operations employ indexing and filtering when appropriate
- Large results can be paginated or truncated to prevent context overflows
- Resource-intensive operations have configurable timeouts

## Future Directions

The tool architecture in gomcptest could evolve in several ways:

1. **Streaming Results**: Supporting incremental results for long-running operations
2. **Tool Discovery**: More sophisticated mechanisms for models to discover available tools
3. **Tool Chaining**: First-class support for composing multiple tools in sequences or pipelines
4. **Interactive Tools**: Tools that can engage in multi-step interactions with the model
5. **Persistent State**: Optional state maintenance for tools that benefit from context

## Conclusion

The MCP tools in gomcptest provide a flexible, secure, and extensible foundation for enabling AI agents to interact with their environment. By understanding the architecture and design principles of these tools, developers can effectively utilize the existing tools, extend them with new capabilities, or create entirely new tools that integrate seamlessly with the system.
